# fekoneko blog

My second React project. This time it's a blog site :)

[Backend repository](https://github.com/fekoneko/fekoneko-blog-server) (Node.JS + Express.JS)

## Preview on GitHub Pages

https://fekoneko.github.io/fekoneko-blog/

*Note: on the demonstration page you cannot change the posts*

## Functions available at the moment:

- Viewing, creating, editing and deleting posts
- Search
- Multiple language support (English/Russian/Japanese)
- Theme choice (dark/light)
- User log in and registration (not actually working yet since this needs some backend logic)

## Important!

- use `npm run dev` to run the application in development mode
